# Overview

This document describes in detail the process of generating Keypairs \(public and private key pairs\) and how to generate an address and sign a transaction based on keypairs. It introduces two interface methods and related processes for executing the transaction call. It provides reference information for ProtoBuf data structures. Finally, it illustrates two methods to submit transactions by showing how to generate transaction\_blob with interface call and how to generate transaction\_blob by yourself.
